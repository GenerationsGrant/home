								<p>Even within welfare and criminal justice systems, child and youth abuse can be more prevalent than what is visible in mainstream media. 
<br /><br />
							Youth and children are often sidelined in building solutions for the next generation. Our hope is that this grant will be accessible for individuals regardless of age, (dis)ability, or society's preconceived notions about their capacity.

We believe in the potential of students in tackling child and youth abuse.

								<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
								<p>For additional questions, please feel free to contact us.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								
									<li class="icon fa-flag">
<h3>What are qualities of a successful application?</h3>
									<p>The easiest way to maximize chances of success is to answer as many optional questions as possible, keeping in mind the organizational values of I-EDI. However, due to the fact that the grant is intended to be low-barriers for students without discrimination on age or differing abilities, the questions may not be easy to understand despite our efforts to establish a plain-language grant application. In these cases, please feel free to prepare your responses to optional questions verbally during the interview. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What is the average amount of funding received?</h3>
									<p>The amount of funding is highly variable depending on factors such as the amount of support requested, as well as the geographic location/currency impacting the cost of resources. Applicants are encouraged to request smaller amounts, and expand the project as funding will continue to be available as long as the cap has not been reached. Multi-year projects are especially encouraged. For successful multi-year projects, the historical average is 74838.34 USD. 

</p>
								</li>
									<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Where does the funding come from?</h3>
									<p>The funding comes from our generous private and organizational donors. To support the grant and/or make a donation, please contact us.</p>
								</li>
									<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What are eligible expenses?</h3>
									<p>Generations: Global Grant does not outline eligible expenses, but rather, each expense item is judged individually by two criteria: 1) the directness of impact for victims/survivors, as well as 2) any autonomy of victims/survivors in deciding how the grant is allocated. </p>
								</li>
									<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Can I submit multiple ideas?</h3>
									<p>Individuals are allowed to submit up to two ideas simultaneously. Please keep in mind that the same idea or project can receive continued funding into the future. Do not make three or more simultaneous submissions. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>How long will it take to know if I am successful?</h3>
									<p>Our bi-monthly rolling system will acknowledge receipt within 1 week of your submitted application. Individuals may be asked to clarify fields by text communications. On average, the first interview is held within the first two months of submission date. </p>
								</li>


	<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What questions will be asked during the interview?</h3>
									<p>The questions will be tailored to your application, and questions will not be released prior to the interview. If other team members are involved, your team may be divided for individual interviews. In other words, please be prepared for each member to be able to answer questions. </p>
